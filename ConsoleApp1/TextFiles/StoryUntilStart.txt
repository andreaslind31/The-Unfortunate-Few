Ugh.. Where are you? 
The wind is howling. Breathe. In.. out.. 
The heart is pumping hard still. This was not an easy fight.
You feel the beating in your hands. And ears. Eventhough you can hear other things now instead of just your own heartbeat. 
Focus on the breathing. In.. out..
The 1-on-1 with this low-life has completely drained your energy.
The warm sensation you felt immediately after the orc fell is fading fast. 
And the blood that was warm before has turned to a cold liqiud that sticks to your head and ears.
Have the orc hurt you in any way? 
You go through your body in your mind. 
Ugh.. Concentrate.
Head. No, seems to be fine.
Arms. No. When you move your fingers in the mud you feel like they are not responding as they should. It's fucking freezing.
You cant stay here, back down in the mud.
You must move. Away from this place. From this sad place of a beated, smashed face. Laying face down beside you. 
Is it really the adrenalin that makes you so immobile? Some sort of after-fight paralyzing?
You feel the heartbeats still pumping hard in your hands.
Use it. Use the adrenalin.
Aaaahh... 
You move your legs upwards to your chest to make it easier to get up. Taking spurn now with your hands on the ground.
Ok. As drained as you are you still managed to get up.
You wipe your face with the hand that was not burrowed down in the freezing mud.
Breeeathe. The stars have finally began to be still. The sky seems calm now. Even the branches have stopped moving.

Alright. It's time to get away from this forest and get to somewhere warm.
